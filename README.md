This is a placeholder for README

README should have the following: 
- explanations for each vairable
- install?
- quickstart example command
- inputs (volume, surface area, params JSON)
- outputs (CSV, plots)
- model assumptions, link to docs
- how to cite (if it comes to that, but I doubt it)
- teammate introductions and bios
- 

add more if necessary. 
I have a repo structure written down in my notebook.
